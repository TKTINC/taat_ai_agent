# Acquisition-Focused Documentation for AI Agent Projects

## Overview

This document outlines the acquisition-focused approach for our AI agent projects (TAAT, ALL-USE, MENTOR, STAR-LAB, and DigiME). As an agent studio, our primary goal for most agents is to develop them to acquisition-readiness rather than scaling them as revenue-generating businesses. This strategy requires specific documentation, development practices, and demo preparation to maximize acquisition value.

## Acquisition Strategy

Our agent studio operates with the following strategic approach:
- **TAAT, MENTOR, STAR-LAB, DigiME**: Developed primarily as acquisition targets
- **ALL-USE**: Developed for in-house use for investment and capital growth

For acquisition-targeted agents, we focus on:
1. Technical excellence and innovation
2. Compelling demo capabilities
3. Clean, well-documented architecture
4. Clear intellectual property protection
5. Defined integration pathways for acquirers
