# TAAT Agent Project Implementation Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

This Project Implementation Plan outlines the approach for developing TAAT (Twitter Trade Announcer Tool) as an AI Agent rather than a traditional application. Using the agent-oriented iAI Framework, TAAT will be built as an autonomous entity with perception, cognition, and action capabilities that can monitor trader posts on X (Twitter), identify trade signals, make trading decisions, and execute trades with appropriate human collaboration.

The implementation follows a structured approach with 6 workstreams and 3 progressive phases, focusing on building agent capabilities incrementally while maintaining integration across all aspects of the agent's functionality.

## 2. Project Vision

### Purpose
TAAT Agent will autonomously monitor selected trader accounts on X (Twitter), identify trade signals from natural language posts, evaluate them against user preferences, execute matching trades in the user's brokerage account with appropriate human oversight, and continuously learn from outcomes to improve performance.

### Key Differentiators
- Contextual understanding of trade signals beyond simple pattern matching
- Adaptive learning from trade outcomes and user feedback
- Personalization to individual user preferences and risk tolerance
- Transparent reasoning and explanation of trade decisions
- Collaborative decision-making with configurable autonomy levels

## 3. Implementation Approach

## 4. Workstream Overview

The implementation is organized into 6 workstreams, each with 3 progressive phases:

1. **Agent Foundation**: Core architecture, memory systems, and cognitive framework
2. **Perception Systems**: Social media monitoring, market data integration, contextual awareness
3. **Cognitive Processing**: Signal interpretation, strategy analysis, decision-making
4. **Action Mechanisms**: Communication, trade execution, portfolio management
5. **Learning Systems**: Feedback processing, knowledge refinement, adaptive behavior
6. **Human-Agent Collaboration**: Interaction design, collaborative decision-making, adaptive collaboration
