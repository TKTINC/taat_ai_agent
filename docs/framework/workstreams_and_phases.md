# TAAT Agent Workstreams and Phases

## Overview

This document outlines the workstreams and phases for developing TAAT (Twitter Trade Announcer Tool) as an AI Agent. Unlike traditional application development that focuses on separate services and components, this agent-oriented approach organizes development around core agent capabilities and their progressive enhancement.

## Workstream Structure

The TAAT Agent development is organized into 6 core workstreams, each representing a fundamental capability area:

1. **Agent Foundation**: Core agent architecture, memory systems, and cognitive framework
2. **Perception Systems**: Capabilities for monitoring and understanding social media and market data
3. **Cognitive Processing**: Trade signal interpretation, strategy analysis, and decision-making
4. **Action Mechanisms**: Communication, trade execution, and portfolio management
5. **Learning Systems**: Adaptation, improvement, and knowledge refinement
6. **Human-Agent Collaboration**: Interaction design, explanations, and collaborative decision-making

Each workstream contains 3 phases representing progressive capability development from basic to advanced.

## Workstream 1: Agent Foundation

Focus: Establishing the core agent architecture, memory systems, and cognitive framework that will serve as the foundation for all other capabilities.

### Phase 1: Core Agent Architecture
- Design and implement the basic agent structure with LLM integration
- Establish the perception-cognition-action loop
- Create the agent's system prompt and personality
- Implement basic working memory and context management

### Phase 2: Memory Systems
- Develop episodic memory for storing past experiences
- Implement semantic memory for knowledge representation
- Create procedural memory for learned behaviors
- Build memory retrieval and integration mechanisms

### Phase 3: Advanced Cognitive Framework
- Implement reflection and self-evaluation capabilities
- Develop meta-cognition for strategy selection
- Create mental models of users, traders, and market behavior
- Build advanced reasoning capabilities for complex decisions

## Workstream 2: Perception Systems

Focus: Developing the agent's ability to monitor, gather, and understand information from social media, market data, and user interactions.

### Phase 1: Social Media Monitoring
- Implement X (Twitter) API integration for trader monitoring
- Develop post filtering and relevance assessment
- Create real-time notification processing
- Build historical post analysis capabilities

### Phase 2: Market Data Integration
- Implement market data API connections
- Develop price and volume monitoring
- Create market context awareness
- Build correlation detection between posts and market movements

### Phase 3: Advanced Contextual Awareness
- Implement multi-source information fusion
- Develop trader credibility assessment
- Create market sentiment analysis
- Build predictive monitoring for anticipated signals

## Workstream 3: Cognitive Processing

Focus: Developing the agent's ability to interpret trade signals, analyze strategies, evaluate opportunities, and make trading decisions.

### Phase 1: Signal Interpretation
- Implement basic trade signal recognition
- Develop parameter extraction (symbol, action, price, etc.)
- Create confidence scoring for signal clarity
- Build disambiguation capabilities for unclear signals

### Phase 2: Strategy Analysis
- Implement signal evaluation against user preferences
- Develop risk/reward assessment
- Create portfolio impact analysis
- Build market condition consideration

### Phase 3: Advanced Decision-Making
- Implement scenario simulation for potential outcomes
- Develop multi-factor decision optimization
- Create adaptive strategy selection
- Build predictive modeling for trade outcomes

## Workstream 4: Action Mechanisms

Focus: Developing the agent's ability to communicate with users, execute trades, manage portfolio positions, and take other actions in the environment.

### Phase 1: Communication Generation
- Implement notification and alert creation
- Develop explanation generation for decisions
- Create status reporting capabilities
- Build query response mechanisms

### Phase 2: Trade Execution
- Implement brokerage API integration
- Develop order creation and submission
- Create execution monitoring and confirmation
- Build error handling and recovery

### Phase 3: Portfolio Management
- Implement position tracking and reconciliation
- Develop portfolio rebalancing recommendations
- Create risk management actions
- Build performance reporting and analysis

## Workstream 5: Learning Systems

Focus: Developing the agent's ability to learn from experience, adapt to changing conditions, and improve its performance over time.

### Phase 1: Feedback Processing
- Implement outcome tracking for trades
- Develop user feedback integration
- Create performance metric calculation
- Build basic pattern recognition for successful strategies

### Phase 2: Knowledge Refinement
- Implement trader model updating
- Develop strategy effectiveness learning
- Create market pattern recognition
- Build knowledge base expansion and refinement

### Phase 3: Adaptive Behavior
- Implement autonomous strategy adjustment
- Develop continuous self-improvement mechanisms
- Create transfer learning between different traders/markets
- Build exploration vs. exploitation balancing

## Workstream 6: Human-Agent Collaboration

Focus: Developing effective interaction between the agent and human users, including explanations, collaborative decision-making, and trust building.

### Phase 1: Basic Interaction Design
- Implement clear communication protocols
- Develop transparent decision explanations
- Create configuration interfaces for preferences
- Build notification and alert management

### Phase 2: Collaborative Decision-Making
- Implement shared decision processes
- Develop option presentation with pros/cons
- Create trust-building mechanisms
- Build feedback collection and incorporation

### Phase 3: Adaptive Collaboration
- Implement personalized interaction styles
- Develop user mental model refinement
- Create variable autonomy based on trust and performance
- Build relationship development over time

## Implementation Approach

Each phase within each workstream will have a dedicated implementation prompt that provides detailed guidance for development. The implementation will follow this sequence:

1. **Foundation First**: Begin with Workstream 1 (Agent Foundation) to establish the core architecture
2. **Capability Building**: Develop Phase 1 across all workstreams to create a minimally viable agent
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Implement Phase 2 and then Phase 3 across all workstreams
4. **Continuous Integration**: Regularly integrate capabilities across workstreams to maintain a cohesive agent

This approach ensures that the agent develops as an integrated whole rather than as separate components that are later combined.

## Dependencies

Key dependencies between workstreams include:

- **Agent Foundation** (WS1) is required for all other workstreams
- **Perception Systems** (WS2) must be developed before advanced **Cognitive Processing** (WS3)
- **Action Mechanisms** (WS4) depend on decisions from **Cognitive Processing** (WS3)
- **Learning Systems** (WS5) require data from all other workstreams
- **Human-Agent Collaboration** (WS6) integrates with all other workstreams

## Evaluation Framework

Each phase will include specific evaluation criteria and testing approaches to ensure the agent is developing as expected. Evaluation will include:

- Capability testing in controlled environments
- Behavioral assessment with historical data
- User experience testing with sample scenarios
- Learning evaluation over simulated time periods

The goal is to create a TAAT Agent that not only performs its core functions but continuously improves its capabilities through experience and feedback.
