# TAAT AI Agent

## Overview

TAAT (Twitter Trade Announcer Tool) AI Agent is an autonomous agent designed to monitor selected trader accounts on X (Twitter), identify trade signals from natural language posts, evaluate them against user preferences, execute matching trades in the user's brokerage account with appropriate human oversight, and continuously learn from outcomes to improve performance.

Unlike traditional applications with predefined workflows, TAAT is built as a true AI Agent with perception, cognition, and action capabilities that can dynamically adapt to achieve its goals.

## Development Approach

TAAT AI Agent follows the agent-oriented iAI Framework with 6 workstreams and 3 progressive phases:

1. **Agent Foundation**: Core architecture, memory systems, and cognitive framework
2. **Perception Systems**: Social media monitoring, market data integration, contextual awareness
3. **Cognitive Processing**: Signal interpretation, strategy analysis, decision-making
4. **Action Mechanisms**: Communication, trade execution, portfolio management
5. **Learning Systems**: Feedback processing, knowledge refinement, adaptive behavior
6. **Human-Agent Collaboration**: Interaction design, collaborative decision-making, adaptive collaboration

## Getting Started

Development instructions will be added as the project progresses.
